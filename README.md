NodeJS project for The Odin Project's Fullstack JavaScript Path

Very simple project to learn NodeJS
It took a little time but I figured out how to add styles to the server.
Able to quickly add stylsheets for requested pages by looking for requests sent by the rendered HTML files with CSS file extensions.
If a requested file matches a file inside the styles directory the stylesheet is written to the response.
After adding the server code to make it work I had a lot of fun playing with color gradients at [cssgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/) and finally settled on the blue gradient theme.
